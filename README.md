# ✅ Task 1: Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This task involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on health-related features from a dataset.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is in `diabetes.xls` format and includes features like:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (target variable: 0 or 1)

## 🔧 Requirements

Install the required libraries with:

pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn xlrd==1.2.0

🚗 Task 2: Car Price & EMI Predictor

This project is part of my Data Science internship. It predicts car prices using machine learning and calculates the EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) based on the predicted price.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab

## 📊 Features
- Car price prediction
- EMI calculation
- Accuracy score & confusion matrix
- Bar chart visualization
